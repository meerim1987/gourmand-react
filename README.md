Gourmand is a culinary project where user has a chance to navigate and see other people's recipes with photos. 
Also an authenticated user can post the recipe with photos and has a chance to comment on other or his/her recipes.
Every recipe has ingredients and directions any user can see on the recipe page and follow step by step or can also line through any ingredient after adding it while cooking.  
Every recipe has a lightbox of the images he/she can see them in close.
On homepage there is carousel of some most popular recipes, also it has recipes sorted by categories for better UX. Further homepage has the latest recipe posted, followed by the random ones.
